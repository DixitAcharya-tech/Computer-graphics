Creating Two Dimensional Objects Using C Graphics

Objective
To write and execute a C program using basic graphics functions to create simple two-dimensional objects such as House, Car, Fish, and Man by using line, circle, ellipse, rectangle, and drawpoly functions.

Theory
Computer Graphics is a field of computer science that deals with generating, manipulating, and displaying visual images using computers. In C language, graphics can be implemented using the BGI (Borland Graphics Interface) library, which provides several built-in functions to draw basic geometric shapes.
Two-dimensional objects are formed by combining simple shapes like lines, circles, rectangles, and polygons. These shapes are drawn on a coordinate system where each point is represented by its X and Y coordinates.
The following graphics functions are used in this experiment:
line(x1, y1, x2, y2):
Draws a straight line between two points.
circle(x, y, r):
Draws a circle with center at (x, y) and radius r.
ellipse(x, y, startangle, endangle, xradius, yradius):
Draws an ellipse with specified center and radii.
rectangle(left, top, right, bottom):
Draws a rectangle using top-left and bottom-right coordinates.
drawpoly(num, points):
Draws polygons like triangles and other closed shapes using a set of points.
By combining these functions, complex objects such as houses, cars, fish, and human figures can be constructed.

Procedure

i. Initialize the graphics driver using initgraph().
ii. Use basic graphics functions such as line, circle, rectangle, ellipse, and drawpoly.
iii. Draw individual components of each object (house, car, fish, man).
iv. Display the output on the screen.
v. Close the graphics mode using closegraph().


Result

The C program was successfully executed, and the two-dimensional objects House, Car, Fish, and Man were displayed on the screen using basic graphics functions.

Conclusion

This experiment helped in understanding the use of basic graphics functions available in C language. By combining simple geometric shapes, complex two-dimensional objects can be created effectively. The experiment demonstrates how computer graphics can be used to visually represent objects using coordinate geometry.
